All data save your local storage. Don`t worry about it.

## Install & Run

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ue/electra your-project-name
```

And then install dependencies with yarn.

```bash
$ cd your-project-name
$ yarn
```

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ gulp electra
```
May need `sudo `

Now you ready to code.
  
Happy coding!
